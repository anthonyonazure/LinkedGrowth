/**
 * The LinkedGrow MCP server (plan section 12b).
 *
 * One remote endpoint per workspace, JSON-RPC over HTTP, identified by the
 * existing lg_live_ API keys rather than a second credential system. The key
 * carries the workspace, so no tool takes a workspace id and a prompt-injected
 * page cannot make an assistant reach into someone else's data.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR. A customer runs their whole LinkedGrow from their
 * assistant: create an agent, aim it at a market, start it, read who replied,
 * write and schedule content. Commanding the platform is the entire point, and
 * an MCP that only answers questions is not worth connecting.
 *
 * THE ONE HARD LINE. Nothing here ever touches the customer's LinkedIn account
 * directly. Every LinkedIn action belongs to their agent, which runs on
 * LinkedGrow's own runner, from its own address, inside the daily caps and the
 * warm-up ramp. So this endpoint starts and steers agents; it never sends an
 * invite or a message itself, and it never accepts LinkedIn credentials. That
 * boundary is what keeps an assistant, and anything that has manipulated one,
 * from doing something to an account that the safety envelope would refuse.
 *
 * The rest of the rules:
 *  1. Ownership is in the WHERE clause, never a check after the fetch.
 *  2. Every state change is logged with its provenance, so the dashboard can
 *     say "started by your assistant" instead of showing a change nobody
 *     remembers making.
 *  3. Third-party text (post bodies, lead headlines, inbound replies) comes
 *     back inside <untrusted-content>. A reply from a stranger is data.
 *  4. Writes are bounded: batch caps, plan quotas, and a spend limiter on
 *     every tool that calls the user's own AI provider.
 *  5. No credentials leave here. No key, password, proxy address or email.
