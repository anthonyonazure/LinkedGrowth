## What is Two-Factor Authentication?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second layer of security to your LinkedGrow account. When enabled, you need both your password and a verification code from an authenticator app to sign in. This means that even if someone discovers your password, they cannot access your account without also having your authenticator device.

We strongly recommend enabling 2FA for all LinkedGrow accounts, especially if you manage business content or collaborate with a team.

## Supported Authenticator Apps

LinkedGrow supports any TOTP-compatible authenticator app. Popular options include:

- **Google Authenticator** - available for iOS and Android
- **Authy** - available for iOS, Android, and desktop
- **1Password** - built-in authenticator in the password manager
- **Microsoft Authenticator** - available for iOS and Android
- **Bitwarden** - built-in authenticator in the password manager

If you already use one of these apps for other services, you can add LinkedGrow as a new entry in the same app.

## How to Enable 2FA

Follow these steps to enable two-factor authentication on your account:

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Find the **Two-Factor Authentication** section
3. Click **Enable 2FA**
4. A QR code will appear on your screen
5. Open your authenticator app and scan the QR code
6. Your authenticator app will generate a 6-digit verification code
7. Enter the verification code in the confirmation field on LinkedGrow
8. Click **Verify and Enable**

Once verified, 2FA is active on your account. You will be prompted for a verification code each time you sign in.

## Signing In with 2FA

After enabling 2FA, your sign-in process works like this:

1. Enter your email and password as usual
2. A second screen will ask for your verification code
3. Open your authenticator app and find the LinkedGrow entry
4. Enter the 6-digit code displayed in the app
5. Click **Verify** to complete sign-in

The code changes every 30 seconds, so make sure to enter the current code. If the code expires while you are typing, wait for the next one and try again.

## How to Disable 2FA

If you need to disable two-factor authentication:

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Find the **Two-Factor Authentication** section
3. Click **Disable 2FA**
4. Enter your current password to confirm
5. Click **Confirm** to disable 2FA

After disabling 2FA, you will only need your password to sign in. We recommend keeping 2FA enabled for better security.

## Lost Access to Your Authenticator

If you lose your phone or cannot open your authenticator app, nobody can sign you in from the outside, because the code is checked against a secret only your own row holds. The way back in is a command the administrator of the instance runs, which clears the two factor fields on your account so that your password alone signs you in again.

On a self hosted instance, from the folder holding `docker-compose.yml`:

```
docker compose exec app npm run db:clear-2fa -- you@example.com
```

The command names the address it cleared, and it stops with a message when no account on that instance uses the address. Every session opened before it runs is signed out, so another browser that was still signed in has to sign in again.

On the hosted service at linkedgrow.ai, write to anthony@tilmsp.com from the address on the account and we run the same command for you.

Once you are back in, set 2FA up again straight away with your new device or app. The old secret is gone and the old QR code no longer works, so go to **Settings** and enable it again with a new one.

## Best Practices

- **Enable 2FA as soon as you create your account** - it takes less than a minute
- **Use a reputable authenticator app** - avoid SMS-based 2FA when possible
- **Keep your authenticator app updated** - older versions may have security issues
- **If you get a new phone**, set up your authenticator on the new device before wiping the old one
