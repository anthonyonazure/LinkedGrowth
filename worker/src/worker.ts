 *    share one address, and two of them acting in the same second is what makes
 *    a household look like a system. The lock is per address, not per agent.
 * 3. Skip anything outside its own business hours, in the account's timezone.
 * 4. Open the session, assert the address, run one bounded sequence pass.
 * 5. On any LinkedIn challenge: stop that account and every agent on it, at
