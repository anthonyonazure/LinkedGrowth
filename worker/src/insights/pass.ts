 * each account's session at most every half hour, only when a post's numbers
 * have actually gone stale, reads them, and closes. An account with no recent
 * posts never opens a browser at all.
 *
 * It is all reading, and reading your own posts is the most ordinary thing
 * anybody does on LinkedIn. It still takes the account's slot, still goes out
 * through the account's own address, and still moves at a human pace, because
 * the rule is about the session rather than about the risk of one action.
