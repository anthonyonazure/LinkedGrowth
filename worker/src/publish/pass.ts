 * this minute and served the next one. Two Chromes on one profile is the single
 * easiest thing for LinkedIn to spot, and no feature is worth it.
 *
 * Three jobs come through here, decided by `actionFor`:
 *
 *   publish  somebody pressed Publish, or a scheduled post missed its window
 *   prepare  write tomorrow's post tonight and let LinkedIn's own scheduler hold it
 *   confirm  LinkedIn has published a scheduled one, go and find it and comment
