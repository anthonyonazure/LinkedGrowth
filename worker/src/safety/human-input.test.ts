/**
 * Two rules that are easy to write code against and easy to forget.
 *
 * **Everything an account does goes through its own address.** Publishing and
 * reading analytics were added after the agent loop and each opens its own
 * session, so each had to remember to ask for the allocation and to refuse in
 * production without one. Forgetting is invisible in development, where there
 * is no allocation anyway, and in production it means an account acting from a
 * datacentre.
 *
 * **Everything an account types goes through the persona's keyboard.** There is
 * a good typing model in human.ts, with this account's own speed, pauses that
 * cluster at words and sentences, and typos backspaced out. Playwright's
 * pressSequentially takes a delay and looks close enough, which is how the
 * post composer and the message composer ended up typing at two different
 * rhythms for the same person.
