/**
 * Putting a file where the dashboard already reads from.
 *
 * Only avatars go through here so far, and they have to: LinkedIn serves member
 * photos from signed URLs that expire, so storing the URL gives you a picture
 * that works today and a broken image next week. The file has to be copied.
 *
 * Two places it can go. The cloud has its R2 bucket, read from the
 * environment. A self hosted instance writes to the disk the app serves
 * unless the wizard pointed it at a bucket of its own, in which case the same
 * SigV4 request goes there, with the host and the region the row names.
 *
 * Signed by hand rather than with the AWS SDK. It is one PUT, the signature is
 * sixty lines, and the alternative is a dependency tree measured in megabytes
 * on a box whose whole job is running browsers.
 *
 * Everything degrades quietly when nothing is configured: a worker without a
 * bucket stores no picture and keeps working, because a missing avatar is a
 * cosmetic problem and a crashed session is not.
